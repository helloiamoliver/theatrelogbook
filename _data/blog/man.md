**Theatre**      Kingswood Theatre  



As part of the 275 Celebrations, the Volez theatre company came to school and gave a performance of The Man Who Thought He Knew Too Much.
It was incredible to watch, and the use of physical theatre to creat effect was gripping.

The lights were versatile, but exciting.

All in all, it was amazing!
