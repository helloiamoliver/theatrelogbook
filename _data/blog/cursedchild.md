★★★☆☆

The mammoth play that is Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. 
Shown in 2 parts, each with a runtime of 2h 45m, it was a marathon to watch!

First, the bad:
There was some poor acting. With the exception of the two leads, most actors were wooden and lacking in conviction.
As well as this, the play was over-long (shock-horror!). I could easily have shaved about 2 hours off it - there was too much standing around, and the plot felt very wooly at times.
