Hmmm... Waldo's Circus of Magic & Terror is tricky. On the one hand, the individual performers were amazing. 
Waldo himself was exactly my idea of a circus owner, and Krista stood out from the crowd.

However, the plot itself was weak. Very little happened in the first half, and the second half felt overly rushed and inconclusive. 
Given they had a full 2h 40m to play with, it's not particularly impressive.
